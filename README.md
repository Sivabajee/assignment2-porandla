### Kansas City Museum
The Kansas City Museum is a history museum. It preserves, interprets, and celebrates Kansas City through collections, exhibitions, and bold programs that reflect the City’s evolution and spirit, and engage visitors in unfolding stories about Kansas City’s vibrant history, cultural heritage, and pride. **Betty Milbank Waldrop Salon** and **The Charles & Anna Milbank Library** are two of my favorites.
